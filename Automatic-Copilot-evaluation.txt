AUTOMATIC COPILOT EVALUATION REPORT
Course: Digital Transformation and Enterprise Architecture
Assignment: Stellar Luminosity – Linear and Polynomial Regression
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The repository implements both parts of the assignment with solid technical
correctness and completeness. All mandatory components are present: cost
surface, convergence plots, multiple learning-rate experiments, feature
selection experiments (M1/M2/M3), interaction-coefficient sweep, and an
inference demo. The code is clean and the mathematical derivations are
correctly stated in markdown. The main weaknesses are (1) missing text
discussion after the convergence plot in Notebook 1, (2) lack of a side-by-side
summary comparing M1/M2/M3 final losses in Notebook 2, and (3) absence of
feature normalization in Notebook 2, which forces the use of an extremely small
learning rate (1e-9) and likely limits full convergence. AWS SageMaker evidence
is well documented with multiple screenshots.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GRADING BREAKDOWN (0.0 – 5.0 scale)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Repository Structure & Compliance .................. 0.5 / 0.5
   - README.md present: YES
   - Two notebooks covering Part I and Part II: YES
     (01_part1_linreg_1feature.ipynb, 02_part2_polyreg.ipynb)
   - Datasets defined inside notebooks: YES (M, L, T arrays hardcoded)
   - Only allowed libraries used: YES
     (numpy, matplotlib; pandas listed in pip install but never imported)
   - No ML libraries: confirmed
   Full credit awarded.

2. Notebook 1 – Linear Regression (One Feature) ....... 1.6 / 2.0

   Items present:
   + Dataset visualization: scatter plot of M vs L with labels.
   + Linearity comment: brief but present.
   + Hypothesis function (predict): correctly defined.
   + MSE cost function (compute_cost): correct formula, 1/(2n) scaling.
   + Cost surface: 3D surface plot over a w-b grid; explanation of minimum present.
   + Gradient derivation: partial derivatives correctly shown in LaTeX.
   + Non-vectorized gradients (compute_gradients): correct loop implementation.
   + Vectorized gradients (compute_gradients_vectorized): correct NumPy form.
   + Gradient descent loop: correctly implemented.
   + Convergence plot (MANDATORY): cost vs iterations plot present.
   + Multiple learning-rate experiments (MANDATORY): three rates [0.1, 0.5, 0.001].
   + Final fit plot: regression line overlaid on data.
   + Conceptual questions answered: meaning of w, limits of linearity.

   Deductions:
   - (-0.2) Convergence discussion is absent: Section 6 shows the plot but
     provides no written comment on convergence speed or stability.
   - (-0.1) The three learning-rate experiments do not include a comparison
     convergence plot showing all three curves on the same axes, which would
     make the comparison more informative.
   - (-0.1) Learning rate α=0.5 is large enough to cause divergence for this
     dataset, but this is neither detected nor noted; the printed output would
     show NaN/inf or oscillating values that are not discussed.

3. Notebook 2 – Polynomial Regression (Two Features) .. 1.5 / 2.0

   Items present:
   + Dataset visualization with temperature color encoding (viridis scatter).
   + Feature engineering [M, T, M², M·T] correctly built as design matrix.
   + Vectorized cost function (error.T @ error form): correct.
   + Vectorized gradients (X.T @ error / m): correct.
   + Gradient descent implemented for multiple features.
   + Convergence plot (linear and log scale): present.
   + Feature selection experiment M1/M2/M3 (MANDATORY): all three models
     trained with separate plots.
   + Interaction cost analysis – w_MT sweep (MANDATORY): implemented and
     interpreted correctly.
   + Inference demo (MANDATORY): new star (M=1.3, T=6600) predicted and
     interpreted as type-F star; result is physically plausible.

   Deductions:
   - (-0.2) No feature normalization / standardization applied before training.
     T ranges from 3800–9200 while M ranges from 0.6–2.4; this scale mismatch
     forces an extremely small learning rate (1e-9) and likely results in
     incomplete convergence within 1000–2000 iterations. This reflects a gap
     in practical understanding of multi-feature gradient descent.
   - (-0.15) M1/M2/M3 feature selection lacks an explicit side-by-side
     summary (e.g., a table or combined plot) comparing final costs. Costs are
     printed for each model but not consolidated or discussed comparatively.
   - (-0.15) Convergence discussion after Section 4.2 is minimal; no written
     analysis of what the log-scale plot reveals about learning dynamics.

4. Cloud Execution Evidence (SageMaker) ............... 0.45 / 0.5

   Items present:
   + Description of SageMaker setup and login procedure: YES.
   + Screenshot of notebooks loaded in SageMaker (JupyterPreview.png): YES.
   + Screenshots of successful execution (runningNotebook1.png,
     runningNotebook2.png): YES.
   + Screenshot showing a cell with output/plot (runningAnyCell.png): YES.
   + Local vs cloud comparison: present (brief sentence noting identical
     behavior, only launch time differed).

   Deductions:
   - (-0.05) The local vs cloud comparison is very brief (one sentence).
     A slightly more detailed discussion (e.g., resource limits, cost, or
     reproducibility considerations) would have been more complete.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FINAL GRADE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Repository structure & compliance:  0.50
Notebook 1 – Linear regression:     1.60
Notebook 2 – Polynomial regression: 1.50
Cloud execution evidence:           0.45
                                   ------
Total:                              4.05 / 5.0

Final grade: 4.05 / 5.0

RESULT: PASS  (threshold ≥ 3.0)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRENGTHS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- All five mandatory items (cost surface, convergence plot, learning-rate
  experiments, interaction sweep, inference demo) are present and functional.
- Mathematical derivations are correctly typeset in LaTeX within markdown cells,
  demonstrating understanding of the underlying calculus.
- Both vectorized and non-vectorized gradient implementations are provided and
  give identical results, which is exactly what the assignment requires.
- Feature engineering is clean and correct: M², M·T correctly computed via
  NumPy broadcasting.
- The interaction-coefficient sweep (Section 6 of Notebook 2) is well
  implemented and the conclusion correctly identifies whether the interaction
  term is significant.
- AWS SageMaker evidence is thorough with multiple labeled screenshots covering
  the full workflow from instance creation to cell execution.
- Repository structure is clean and follows the recommended layout.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ISSUES & MISSING ELEMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- No written convergence discussion in Notebook 1 after the convergence plot
  (speed, stability, or stopping criterion not discussed in text).
- No multi-curve learning-rate comparison plot in Notebook 1 (three experiments
  exist but are not visually compared on a single axes).
- Diverging behavior for α=0.5 in Notebook 1 is not acknowledged or handled.
- Feature normalization is absent in Notebook 2, resulting in a learning rate
  that is 9 orders of magnitude below typical values; convergence quality is
  uncertain.
- No consolidated M1/M2/M3 cost comparison table or combined convergence plot
  in Notebook 2; models are trained in isolation without explicit comparison.
- Pandas is listed as a pip dependency in Notebook 2 but is never used.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TA FEEDBACK TO STUDENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your submission shows a good grasp of the mechanics of gradient descent and
polynomial feature engineering. The code is correct, well-organized, and all
mandatory sections are present, which is commendable.

Three targeted improvements would meaningfully strengthen your work:

1. Always follow a convergence plot with a written interpretation. For example:
   "The cost drops steeply in the first 200 iterations and plateaus thereafter,
   indicating that α=0.01 converges within the budget." This is the analytical
   habit that demonstrates real understanding.

2. In any multi-feature problem, normalize or standardize your features before
   training. When T is in the thousands and M is near 1, the gradient for the
   T-feature will dominate and force you to use a tiny learning rate. Apply
   z-score normalization (subtract mean, divide by std) per feature before
   building the design matrix. This is standard practice and will allow a
   reasonable α such as 1e-3 or 1e-2.

3. For the feature selection experiment, add a short summary table or a combined
   plot at the end:
       Model | Features         | Final Cost
       M1    | M, T             | ...
       M2    | M, T, M²         | ...
       M3    | M, T, M², M·T    | ...
   This makes the comparison clear and is the kind of rigorous reporting
   expected at the graduate level.

Overall, solid first submission. Focus on linking every numerical or graphical
result to a brief written interpretation.

AI-GENERATION ASSESSMENT (NON-GRADING – INFORMATIONAL ONLY)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. Qualitative Assessment

   Indicators consistent with AI-assisted generation:
   - Markdown section headers are unusually uniform in tone and capitalization
     across both notebooks (e.g., "Implement ME (Cost Function) and gradients
     w.r.t. both w and b.").
   - LaTeX derivations in the markdown cells are syntactically perfect and
     formatted in a textbook style that rarely appears in student-written notes.
   - Explanatory comments are generic and interchangeable (e.g., "we recall",
     "we now implement", "we put everything together").
   - The non-vectorized and vectorized gradient functions follow a near-canonical
     tutorial structure with identical variable naming conventions.

   Indicators consistent with human work:
   - There are minor inconsistencies (e.g., variable shadowing: `n` is
     reassigned in Notebook 2 cell 13 after being defined earlier), which is a
     typical human oversight.
   - The README reflects personal experience in Spanish-inflected English
     ("the time i had to wait") and contains specific institutional details.
   - The learning-rate selection (0.1, 0.5, 0.001) is somewhat arbitrary and
     lacks the careful rationale that an AI would typically provide.
   - Section 9 conceptual answers are brief and conversational rather than
     polished.

B. Quantitative Estimate
   Code:                ~50–60% AI involvement
   Explanations / markdown: ~55–65% AI involvement
   README:              ~20–30% AI involvement

C. Commentary
   The notebook code and mathematical markdown appear to draw heavily from
   standard tutorial patterns (e.g., Andrew Ng's ML course structure), which
   are also commonly reproduced by AI tools. The README and short conceptual
   answers feel more personally written. The practical gap (missing
   normalization, undiscussed divergence) suggests that the student may have
   used AI assistance to scaffold the code but did not fully verify or
   critically analyze all outputs independently.

   This assessment is observational and does not imply misconduct.
