# Stellar luminosity - Linear and Polynomial Models for Regression

Working repository with notebooks to practice linear regression (single feature) and polynomial regression using stellar luminosity data.

## Description
This project contains Jupyter Notebook exercises to explore regression models on astronomical data. It includes:
- Linear regression with a single feature.
- Polynomial regression.

## Getting Started
These instructions will help you run the notebooks locally for development or practice.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+ (or the version you use in your environment)
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Typical data science packages (e.g., `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`)
### Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment.
3. Install dependencies.

If you use `pip`, you can create a `requirements.txt` and list your dependencies.
## Usage
Open the notebooks in the suggested order:
- 01_part1_linreg_1feature.ipynb
- 02_part2_polyreg.ipynb

Run the cells to reproduce the results.

## AWS SageMaker Execution Evidence
Brief description of how the notebooks were uploaded to SageMaker:
- Describe the upload method (e.g., upload via SageMaker Studio file browser, Git clone, or S3 sync).

Screenshots (add images below):
- Both notebooks visible/open in SageMaker.
- Successful execution (cells run and outputs visible).
- At least one plot rendered in SageMaker.

Local vs SageMaker execution notes:
- Briefly compare any differences observed (performance, environment, package versions, or outputs).

## Tests
There are currently no automated tests. If you add tests, describe how to run them here.

## Built With
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
